Numpy = Numerical Python
    - Integrates well with APIs, Databases, Web Pages
    
    - Underneath, Numpy was built with c programming, to make it faster.
    
    - Example of a Numpy Operation:- 
            list = [1, 2, 3]                # Not Anymore
            array = np.array([1, 2, 3])     # Perfection {10x times faster}
    
    - Vectorized Operation
        Example:- 
            np.array([1, 2, 3]) * 2 = [2, 4, 6]     # Using Numpy
            [1, 2, 3] * 2 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]      # Using Python List

    - <class 'numpy.ndarray'> means n-dimensional array
